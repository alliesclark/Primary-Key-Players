# Project Title: Co-op Connect

## Collaborators
    Primary Key Players — Allie Clark, Martin Hema, Miles Mu, Sabrina Valerjev

# Problem Description
    Several stakeholders face challenges in the co-op application process: students struggle to connect with peers and companies, share or access feedback, and feel unprepared due to limited information on companies and interview specifics. Employers face difficulties in reaching and engaging qualified candidates, effectively advertising roles, and gathering feedback from co-op participants. Advisors also find it challenging to foster student-recruiter relationships and collect insights about students’ co-op experiences. These groups need streamlined solutions to address these challenges: students need platforms for peer advice, company reviews, and personalized job searches; employers need tools to identify qualified candidates, facilitate communication, and collect insights to improve their co-op program; advisors need effective tools to foster connections effeciently and gain deeper insights into students' co-op experiences.

# Project Description
    Co-op Connect is a data-driven co-op search platform designed to bridge the gap between students, alumni, recruiters, and advisors. It empowers students to navigate the co-op search process through a comprehensive, user-driven database of interview questions, insider tips, and reviews from previous co-op participants. The platform keeps users informed about positions filled before their deadlines, allowing them to focus on open opportunities.

    Built for motivated students, recent graduates, and alumni, Co-op Connect also supports advisors by providing tools to facilitate connections between students and recruiters, keep track of student profiles, and gather valuable feedback on student experiences. Former interns can share reviews on companies and roles, offering transparency and insights. Recruiters can easily post and compare job descriptions, locate and connect with students with desired experience, and gather feedback from former co-ops on their experiences in the position. By streamlining the research process and equipping users with actionable intel, Co-op Connect makes the path to co-op success more informed, efficient, and accessible for all stakeholders.
