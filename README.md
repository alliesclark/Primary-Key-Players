# Project Title: Co-op Connect

## Collaborators
    Allie Clark, Martin Hema, Miles Mu, Sabrina Valerjev

# Problem Description
    Several stakeholders face challenges in the co-op process: students struggle to connect with peers or company contacts, share or access feedback, and feel unprepared due to limited information on companies and interview specifics. Employers face difficulty in reaching and engaging the right candidates, advertising roles effectively, and gathering feedback from co-op participants. Advisors struggle to facilitate student-recruiter relationships and gain feedback on students’ experience on co-op. These groups need streamlined ways to connect—students seek platforms for peer advice, company reviews, and tailored job searches, while employers need tools to locate qualified candidates, facilitate communication, and collect insights to improve their co-op programs.

# Project Description
    Co-op Connect is a data-driven co-op search platform designed to bridge the gap between students, alumni, recruiters, and advisors. It empowers students to navigate the co-op search process through a comprehensive, user-driven database of interview questions, insider tips, and reviews from previous co-op participants. The platform keeps users informed about positions filled before their deadlines, allowing them to focus on open opportunities.

    Built for motivated students, recent graduates, and alumni, Co-op Connect also supports advisors by providing tools to facilitate connections between students and recruiters, keep track of student profiles, and gather valuable feedback on student experiences. Former interns can share reviews on companies and roles, offering transparency and insights. By streamlining the research process and equipping users with actionable intel, Co-op Connect makes the path to co-op success more informed, efficient, and accessible for all stakeholders.
