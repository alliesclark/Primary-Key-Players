# Project Title: Co-op Connect

## Collaborators
    Allie Clark, Martin Hema, Miles Mu, Sabrina Valerjev
# Problem Description
    Several stakeholders face challenges in the co-op process: students struggle to connect with peers or company contacts, share or access feedback, and feel unprepared due to limited information on companies and interview specifics. Employers face difficulty in reaching and engaging the right candidates, advertising roles effectively, and gathering feedback from co-op participants. Advisors struggle to facilitate student-recruiter relationships and gain feedback on students’ experience on co-op. These groups need streamlined ways to connect—students seek platforms for peer advice, company reviews, and tailored job searches, while employers need tools to locate qualified candidates, facilitate communication, and collect insights to improve their co-op programs.
